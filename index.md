### Biography

I'm a first-year Ph.D.student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, supervised by professor [Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen) and [Haipeng Dai](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/).

### Interests

1. [Time Series Database](https://github.com/Josehokec/Time-Series-Database), mainly focus on [IoT(Internet of Things) Database](https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/)
2. [Learned Index](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3183713.3196909), learned index = machine learning + index structure
3. [Probabilistic data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Probabilistic_data_structures), for example: bloom filter, sketch and cuckoo filter
4. [Machine Learning & Data Mining](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx), people who work in computer-related jobs are interested in AI

### Education
I received my B.Eng. degree from Software College of [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/). 

In September 2021, I was admitted to pursue for a Ph.D. degree in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) without entrance examination.

### Awards & Honors & Publication
#### None or nothing
I am working on IoTDB. At the moment I lack a lot of ability and I'm trying to imporove myself.

Always, I believe : 
1. No pain, no gain.
2. With great power comes great responsibility.

### Biography
I'm a third-year Ph.D.student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, supervised by professor [Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen) ([IEEE Fellow](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/585760274) and [CCF Fellow](https://www.ccf.org.cn/Membership/Individual_member/Honor/2021-07-21/671453.shtml))and [Haipeng Dai](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/).

I received my B.Eng. degree from the Software College of [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in June 2021 (**GPA Rank 3/353**). In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a Ph.D. in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) without an entrance examination.

### Interests

1. **Time Series Database** [[slides](/Introduction_to_Time_Series_Database.pdf)], mainly focus on [IoT (Internet of Things) Database](https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/)
2. **Artificial Intelligence for Database（AI4DB for short)** [[survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3457542)], includes [Learned Index](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3183713.3196909) (Machine Learning + Index Structure),  [Learned Query](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p307-sun.pdf) (Machine Learning for Cost Estimation and Cardinality Estimation), and [Knob Tuning](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2118-li.pdf)
3. **Probabilistic data structure**, for example, bloom filter, sketch [[slides](/sketch.pptx) (Ref: 2022. Tong Yang. High performance Network Measurement.)], and cuckoo filter
4. **Database Index Structure**, includes [Timeseries Index](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-019-00573-w) and [B+/LSM Tree Index](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3299869.3300097)
5. **Time Series Data Mning** [[slides](/Time_Series_Data_Mining.pdf)]


### Awards & Honors
Nanjing University Presidental Special Scholarship, 2021

### Publication

[UbiComp'23] Lihao Wang, Wei Wang, Haipeng Dai, **Shizhe Liu**. "MagSound: Magnetic Field Assisted Wireless Earphone Tracking". In Proceedings of the ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, October 8-12, Cancun, Mexico, 2023. 

*First author paper: None or nothing.* I have written a paper and recently submitted it to VLDB.

I am working on IoTDB. Currently, I lack a lot of ability, and I'm trying to improve myself.

Consistently, I believe : 
1. ***No pain, no gain.***
2. With great power comes great responsibility.

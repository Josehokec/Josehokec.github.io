### Biography
I'm a second-year Ph.D.student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, supervised by professor [Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen) and [Haipeng Dai](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/).

I received my B.Eng. degree from the Software College of [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in June 2021. In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a Ph.D. in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) without an entrance examination.

I was born in Hunan, so I like spicy food very much. Welcome to challenge super spicy food with me.

### Publication
*None or nothing*（I helped Lihao Wang complete a paper in the past, and the paper is in the voting.）

I am working on IoTDB. Currently, I lack a lot of ability, and I'm trying to improve myself.

Consistently, I believe : 
1. ***No pain, no gain.***
2. With great power comes great responsibility.

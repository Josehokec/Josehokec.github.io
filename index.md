### Biography
I'm a third-year Ph.D.student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, supervised by professor [Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen) ([IEEE Fellow](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/585760274) and [CCF Fellow](https://www.ccf.org.cn/Membership/Individual_member/Honor/2021-07-21/671453.shtml))and [Haipeng Dai](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/).

I received my B.Eng. degree from the Software College of [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in June 2021 (**GPA Rank 3/353**). In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a Ph.D. in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) without an entrance examination.

### Interests

1. **Complex Event Processing** [[survey](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-019-00557-w)]
2. **Time Series Database** [[slides](/Introduction_to_Time_Series_Database.pdf)], mainly focus on [IoT (Internet of Things) Database](https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/)
3. **Probabilistic data structure**, for example, bloom filter, sketch [[slides](/sketch.pptx) (Ref: 2022. Tong Yang. High performance Network Measurement.)], and cuckoo filter
4. **Database Index Structure**, includes [Timeseries Index](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-019-00573-w) and [B+/LSM Tree Index](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3299869.3300097)
5. **Time Series Data Mining** [[slides](/Time_Series_Data_Mining.pdf)]


### Awards & Honors

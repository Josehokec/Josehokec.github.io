### Biography
I'm a first-year Ph.D.student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, supervised by professor [Guihai Chen](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/gchen) and [Haipeng Dai](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/daihp/).

I received my B.Eng. degree from the Software College of [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in June 2021. In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a Ph.D. in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) without an entrance examination.

I was born in Hunan, so I like spicy food very much. I am a single boy currently. 

### Interests

1. [Time Series Database](https://github.com/Josehokec/Time-Series-Database), mainly focus on [IoT(Internet of Things) Database](https://iotdb.apache.org/zh/)
2. [Learned Index](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3183713.3196909), learned index = machine learning + index structure
3. [Probabilistic data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Probabilistic_data_structures), for example, bloom filter, sketch, and cuckoo filter
4. Index Structure for Big Series Data
5. [Machine Learning & Data Mining](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx), people who do computer-related research are interested in AI

### Awards & Honors
Nanjing University President's Special Scholarship, 2021

Nanjing University Admission scholarship, 2021

### Publication
*None or nothing*

I am working on IoTDB. Currently, I lack a lot of ability, and I'm trying to improve myself.

Consistently, I believe : 
1. ***No pain, no gain.***
2. With great power comes great responsibility.

### Volunteer Service 

1. Fundamentals of Computer Systems (For undergraduate students, Fall 2021)

    => I am a teaching assistant assisting teachers in answering questions and correcting homework.

2. Counselor assistant (For graduate students, Spring 2022)

    => Help the counselor handle some affairs of the graduate student.
